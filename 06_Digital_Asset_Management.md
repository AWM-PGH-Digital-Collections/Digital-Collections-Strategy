# 6. Digital Asset Management


### 6.1 The Power of a DAMS


### 6.2 User Access and the IIIF Viewer

Access to image-based resources is fundamental to research, scholarship and the transmission of cultural knowledge. Digital images are a container for much of the information content in the Web-based delivery of images, books, newspapers, manuscripts, maps, scrolls, single sheet collections, and archival materials. Yet much of the Internet’s image-based resources are locked up in silos, with access restricted to bespoke, locally built applications.

A growing community of the world’s leading research libraries and image repositories have embarked on an effort to collaboratively produce an interoperable technology and community framework for image delivery.

IIIF (International Image Interoperability Framework) has the following goals:

To give scholars an unprecedented level of uniform and rich access to image-based resources hosted around the world.
To define a set of common application programming interfaces that support interoperability between image repositories.
To develop, cultivate and document shared technologies, such as image servers and web clients, that provide a world-class user experience in viewing, comparing, manipulating and annotating images.

### 6.3 Making the Case: Why We Need a Curator of Digital Objects

Traditionally, curators are responsible for acquiring material for a collection, preserving these materials for future generations, helping users locate items from the collection and providing contextual information so they can better understand them, and designing exhibits for the benefit and enjoyment of the public. A digital curator will do all of these things, provide oversight and direction, as well as the following:

Make as much of our collection available online as copyright law, professional ethics, and our budget permits.
 
Provide both contextual information and software tools to make our digital collections as useful as possible.
 
Improve methods for preserving and providing access to the "born digital"  materials that are now part of the creative history of most contemporary works of art.
